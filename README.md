# cipherMachine-swiftUI

This app was an opportunity for me to create an app that encrypts and decrypts data. I decided to start simple on the encryption and implemented a Caesar-shift cipher technique. I made it a little more complex to include 94 different characters (including lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and symbols) instead of the classic 26 letter Caesar cipher method.
